# tabby
footykeeper's code editor. Made for developing offline or online, it can be downloaded as a .zip file and used without an internet connection, assuming you downloaded it while online.

If you have a change to suggest, feel free to fork the repository and create a pull request. At the moment, we would be especially welcome to:

Autocomplete features (suggest code based on user input)

CSS Improvements (the editor is slightly ugly)

Better editing experiances

We will not consider pull requests that are extremely supericial, ie. adding comments or renaming variables.

Feel free to download the repository for personal use or even redistribute it. Of course, remember to read the [license](https://footykeeper.github.io/tabby/LICENSE.txt) to ensure legal usage of the code.
